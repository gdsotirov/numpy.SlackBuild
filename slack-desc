numpy: NumPy (array processing for numbers, strings, records, and objects)
numpy:
numpy: NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
numpy: efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
numpy: records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
numpy: arrays. NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
numpy: introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability
numpy: to create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable
numpy: for interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.
numpy: There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform, basic
numpy: linear algebra and random number generation.
